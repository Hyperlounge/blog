Around 1980, I and a friend came up to Leicester Uni to study engineering, having become friends while at school in Brighton. We were both into photography and fascinated by the industrial landscape we encountered in an around Leicester, so different from what we had known down south. We had many picture taking trips when we should have been doing homework, and it was a productive time photographically. In 1980 we were in a world before ubiquitous photography, and even as 20 year olds with our reasonably priced SLRs we were often taken to be professional photographers, perhaps working for a local newspaper.
